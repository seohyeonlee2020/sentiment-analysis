    "Now that we've outlined the structure and objectives of this project, let's delve into the core concept: sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This can range from identifying the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of a review to analyzing emotions and opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, sentiment analysis is explicitly framed as a **binary classification task**, where the goal is to determine whether a given movie review is *positive* or *negative*. This task is central to many real-world applications, including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and recommendation systems. By developing a transformer-based model, you will classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative to tackle the challenge faced by your entertainment company CineScope by enhancing its recommendation system, enabling more accurate and personalized suggestions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews labeled as positive will be marked as 1 in the dataset, while negative reviews will be labeled as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following movie review:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The movie was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I loved every moment of it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This review is clearly positive as it expresses enjoyment and satisfaction with the movie, hence it will be labelled as *positive* or 1 in the dataset. In contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The plot was predictable, and the acting was subpar. A waste of time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This review conveys a negative sentiment, criticizing both the plot and acting, hence it will be labelled as *negative* or 0 in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are often used for generation tasks, they can also be adapted for classification tasks with some modifications to their architecture. You might already be familiar with the tweaks that we will implement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the [IMDB dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), provided in the `aclIMDB_v1.tar.gz` file. Upon extracting the file, you will find the following folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "aclIMDB/\n",
    "├── train/\n",
    "│   ├── pos/    # Positive reviews for training\n",
    "│   ├── neg/    # Negative reviews for training\n",
    "│   ├── unsup/  # Unsupervised data (not used in this project)\n",
    "├── test/\n",
    "│   ├── pos/    # Positive reviews for testing\n",
    "│   ├── neg/    # Negative reviews for testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **train/**: Contains labeled data for training the model. Reviews in the `pos/` folder should be labeled as positive (1), while reviews in the `neg/` folder should be labeled as negative (0).\n",
    "- **test/**: Contains labeled data for evaluating the model. Similar to the training data, `pos/` and `neg/` contain positive and negative reviews, respectively.\n",
    "- **unsup/**: Contains unlabeled reviews that are not used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the folder structure is crucial as it guides how we load and preprocess the data for the sentiment classification task.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Subword Tokenization\n",
    "In earlier tasks, you might have encountered character-level tokenization, where each character in the text is treated as a token. While this is straightforward, it is less efficient and may result in larger input sizes, impacting the performance of transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we will use Hugging Face's `AutoTokenizer`, a robust and efficient class designed for tokenizing text based on pretrained models. Specifically, we will utilize the `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, which applies **subword tokenization**. Subword tokenization involves two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subword Splitting**: Words are split into smaller components (subwords) based on a predefined vocabulary. For example:\n",
    "   - Input: \"unhappiness\"\n",
    "   - Subword Splits: `['un', 'happiness']`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Conversion**: Each subword is then converted into a numerical token ID. For example:\n",
    "   - Subword Splits: `['un', 'happiness']`\n",
    "   - Token IDs: `[1011, 24123]` (values are illustrative and depend on the tokenizer vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the `bert-base-uncased` Tokenizer\n",
    "The `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, developed by Google researchers, is part of the BERT model family. This tokenizer is associated with the `bert-base-uncased` model, which has been widely used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification. The tokenizer ensures all text is converted to lowercase and accents are removed, reducing vocabulary size and improving generalization. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: \"I Love Transformers.\"\n",
    "- Subword Splits: `['i', 'love', 'trans', '##formers', '.']`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the tokenizer and model on [Hugging Face's bert-base-uncased page](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the `AutoTokenizer` Class\n",
    "The `AutoTokenizer` class in the Hugging Face Transformers library provides a seamless way to load tokenizers for various pretrained models. It automatically selects the correct tokenizer configuration based on the model name.\n"

This implementation builds on the foundation of a transformer architecture and includes the necessary modifications to adapt it for classification. \n",

    "\n",
    "To adapt the transformer for classification, the following changes are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add a Classification-Specific Output Layer**:\n",
    "   - The model needs a linear layer to map the final pooled embeddings to the number of classes. \n",
    "   - The classification head is implemented using [`torch.nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) with:\n",
    "     - `in_features` set to `d_embed` (the embedding dimension).\n",
    "     - `out_features` set to `num_classes` (the number of classes, 2 for binary classification).\n",
    "     - `bias` set to `False` (optional; bias can be excluded to slightly simplify computations).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement a Pooling Mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Transformers output embeddings for each token in the input sequence. For classification, these token-level embeddings need to be condensed into a single vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A **mean pooling operation** is applied using [`torch.mean`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.mean.html) across the time dimension (`dim=1`) to aggregate token-level embeddings into a single representation vector."

    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to calculate the validation accuracy for the transformer model on the IMDB dataset. Validation accuracy provides a performance metric that helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "The function to calculate validation accuracy will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the model on the validation dataset.\n",
    "- Generate predictions for each batch.\n",
    "- Compare predictions with the true labels.\n",
    "- Compute the percentage of correctly classified examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Key Points\n",
    "- **Evaluation Mode**: Calling `model.eval()` ensures that dropout and other training-specific layers are disabled during evaluation.\n",
    "- **No Gradients**: The `torch.no_grad()` context disables gradient computation, reducing memory usage and speeding up validation.\n",
    "- **Predictions**: `torch.argmax(logits, dim=1)` retrieves the index of the highest logit for each sample, which corresponds to the predicted class label.\n",
    "- **Accuracy Calculation**: The function computes the fraction of correct predictions out of the total number of samples, then multiplies by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the validation accuracy, incorporate this function into your training loop. Typically, you would call calculate_accuracy at the end of each epoch or after a specific number of training steps. Monitoring validation accuracy over time helps you track performance gains and identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues."
